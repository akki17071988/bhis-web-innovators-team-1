<h1>Strengthen global food aid programs and emergency responses
</h1>
<p>During natural disasters or conflicts, people often lose access to food. Strengthening global food
aid programs ensures that in times of crisis, emergency food supplies are quickly delivered to
those in need, preventing starvation and malnutrition. These programs also help build resilience,
ensuring affected communities can rebuild their food systems after a crisis. By being prepared
for emergencies, we can reduce the long-term effects of hunger.
