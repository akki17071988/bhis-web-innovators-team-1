<h1>Provide support to undernourished populations
</h1>
<p>Governments and organizations can offer food aid, nutritional supplements, and health services
to vulnerable groups, such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. This helps ensure that
everyone, especially those in need, gets the nourishment they require to stay healthy. Direct
support programs can also focus on improving food distribution in regions where access to food
is limited. By doing so, it creates a safety net for those most at risk of hunger.
